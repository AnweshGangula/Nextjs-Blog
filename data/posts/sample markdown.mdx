# Sample Markdown

This is some basic, sample markdown.

## Second Heading

- Unordered lists, and:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

- More

> Blockquote

And **bold**, _italics_, and even _italics and later **bold**_. Even ~~strikethrough~~. [A link](https://markdowntohtml.com) to somewhere.

And code highlighting:

```js:filename.js
var foo = 'bar';

function baz(s) {
   return foo + ':' + s;
}
```

### Third Heading

Or inline code like `var foo = 'bar';`.

Or an image of bears

![bears](http://placebear.com/200/200)

The end ...
